# ust-mode

An Emacs major mode for editing [UTAU Sequence Text](https://w.atwiki.jp/utaou/?cmd=word&word=ust&type=&pageid=21#id_a90784c7), the project file format for [UTAU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utau).

Although editing an UTAU project is best done with UTAU itself, sometimes it is useful to manipulate it directly as text. This major mode helps with that.
